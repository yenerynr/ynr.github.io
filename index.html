									<p>A data visualization asigment project with an earthquake dataset. In this project, I analyzed and visualized a large dataset to uncover patterns, trends, and insights. I used Python and its data analysis and visualization libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to manipulate, analyze and present the data in an effective and meaningful way. The visualizations were designed to effectively communicate key findings and insights to a non-technical audience. This project demonstrates my ability to work with large datasets, my understanding of data analysis and visualization techniques, and my ability to present complex information in a clear and understandable manner.

									<p>ext-Based Adventure Game: In this project, I developed a simple text-based adventure game using Python. Players are presented with a series of choices that determine their path through the game. The game was created using basic programming concepts such as conditional statements and user inputs, and provides a fun and interactive experience for players. This project showcases my ability to write basic Python code to create a functional and engaging game, and my understanding of programming concepts such as control flow and user inputs.</p>
